Hi there! 👋 I'm currently a beginner in programming and exploring the world of Information Technology. This repository serves as a personal playground where I build beginner-friendly projects to strengthen my foundation in:

🧠 Programming concepts

🧱 Data Structures

🖥️ Basic computer science principles

My goal with L-Projects is to steadily improve my problem-solving skills and gain hands-on experience by creating simple yet meaningful projects. As I grow, I plan to document my progress, share what I’ve learned, and make this repository a helpful resource for other beginners too.

Whether you're here to follow along, collaborate, or just take a peek — welcome, and thanks for stopping by! 😊
